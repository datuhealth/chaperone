        <h2>Chaperone is your friendly guide for responsive web sites and applications.</h2>
        <p>We searched the web for a lightweight script that would allow us to provide our users with a simple guided tour of our app. Though there are some pretty nice tours out there we didn't see any that worked really well at any screen size.</p>
        <p>Thus was born chaperone.js. In your tour array you can specify what screen sizes each step of the tour should be shown on. If the user opens your app/site on their phone they won't be shown the steps designated only for desktop and vice-versa</p>
